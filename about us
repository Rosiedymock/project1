    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>The Monkees are a four member 1960's band playing music from the rock genre. <br><br>We enjoy playing live for events and have been doing so for over 50 years! Which has given us the best experience and we hope that we give the best performances. Music has always played a huge part of all our lives, and gives us the release we need to keep our souls happy. We started our career in television but found our love to be of music and not acting, shortly after our first series ended, as a group we decided to concentrate on our music and created our first album. From there our music career took off, 50 years and thousands of gig's later we are here. The Monkees enjoy playing at events such as weddings, christmas parties, events, and festivals.</p>
